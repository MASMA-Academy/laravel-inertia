## ðŸ“š Useful Tips

### Composer Tips

- Use `composer install --no-dev` in production
- Run `composer dump-autoload --optimize` for better performance
- Use `composer audit` to check for security vulnerabilities
- Use `composer outdated` to check for package updates

### Artisan Tips

- Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands
- Use `php artisan help command-name` for detailed help
- Use `php artisan optimize:clear` when things get weird
- Use `php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0` to access from other devices
- Use `php artisan migrate:status` to check migration state

### Performance Tips

- Use `php artisan optimize` in production
- Use `php artisan route:cache` and `php artisan config:cache` in production
- Use `composer install --optimize-autoloader` in production
- Use `npm run build` instead of `npm run dev` in production
